# Changelog

Changes that need your attention when you upgrade Lair. Lair is 0.x: anything can change between versions, and this
file lists what needs action on your side.

## Unreleased

- **Watchdog escalations moved to the Decision Inbox.** A watchdog escalation is now a decision in the Decisions
  view, and is **no longer appended to `inbox_file`**. If you set `watchdog.escalation_file`, it still gets a copy of
  every escalation as an `- OWNER? ...` entry. `inbox_file` gets one only when a decision can't be raised. See
  [Watchdog](docs/configuration.md#watchdog).
